  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">S/&#8288;MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a consistent way to send and receive secure MIME data.  Based on the popular Internet MIME standard, S/&#8288;MIME provides the following cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications:  authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation of origin (using digital signatures), and data confidentiality (using encryption).  As a supplementary service, S/&#8288;MIME provides for message compression.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">S/&#8288;MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add cryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to interpret cryptographic security services in mail that is received.  However, S/&#8288;MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any transport mechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP or SIP.  As such, S/&#8288;MIME takes advantage of the object-based features of MIME and allows secure messages to be exchanged in mixed-transport systems.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">Further, S/&#8288;MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that use cryptographic security services that do not require any human intervention, such as the signing of software-generated documents and the encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#SpecOverview" id="SpecOverview">Specification Overview</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">This document describes a protocol for adding cryptographic signature and encryption services to MIME data.  The MIME standard <a href="#MIME-SPEC">[MIME-SPEC]</a> provides a general structure for the content of Internet messages and allows extensions for new content-type-based applications.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">This specification defines how to create a MIME body part that has been cryptographically enhanced according to the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <a href="#CMS">[CMS]</a>, which is derived from PKCS #7 <a href="#RFC2315">[RFC2315]</a>.  This specification also defines the application/&#8288;pkcs7-mime media type that can be used to transport those body parts.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">This document also discusses how to use the multipart/&#8288;signed media type defined in <a href="#RFC1847">[RFC1847]</a> to transport S/&#8288;MIME signed messages.  multipart/&#8288;signed is used in conjunction with the application/&#8288;pkcs7-signature media type, which is used to transport a detached S/&#8288;MIME signature.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">In order to create S/&#8288;MIME messages, an S/&#8288;MIME agent MUST follow the specifications in this document, as well as the specifications listed in the Cryptographic Message Syntax document <a href="#CMS">[CMS]</a>, <a href="#RFC3370">[RFC3370]</a>, <a href="#RFC4056">[RFC4056]</a>, <a href="#RFC3560">[RFC3560]</a>, and <a href="#RFC5754">[RFC5754]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">Throughout this specification, there are requirements and recommendations made for how receiving agents handle incoming messages.  There are separate requirements and recommendations for how sending agents create outgoing messages.  In general, the best strategy is to "be liberal in what you receive and conservative in what you send".  Most of the requirements are placed on the handling of incoming messages, while the recommendations are mostly on the creation of outgoing messages.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">The separation for requirements on receiving agents and sending agents also derives from the likelihood that there will be S/&#8288;MIME systems that involve software other than traditional Internet mail clients.  S/&#8288;MIME can be used with any system that transports MIME data.  An automated process that sends an encrypted message might not be able to receive an encrypted message at all, for example.  Thus, the requirements and recommendations for the two types of agents are listed separately when appropriate.  </p>

The presence of an algorthm based SMIME Capability attribute in this sequence implies that the sender can deal with the algorithm as well as undertanding the ASN.1 structures associated with that algorithm.  There are also several identifiers that indicate support for other optional features such as binary encoding and compression.  The SMIMECapabilities were designed to be flexible and extensible so that, in the future, a means of identifying other capabilities and preferences such as certificates can be added in a way that will not cause current clients to break.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.2">If present, the SMIMECapabilities attribute MUST be a SignedAttribute; it MUST NOT be an UnsignedAttribute.  CMS defines SignedAttributes as a SET OF Attribute.  The SignedAttributes in a signerInfo MUST NOT include multiple instances of the SMIMECapabilities attribute.  CMS defines the ASN.1 syntax for Attribute to include attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  A SMIMECapabilities attribute MUST only include a single instance of AttributeValue.  There MUST NOT be zero or multiple instances of AttributeValue present in the attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.3">The semantics of the SMIMECapabilities attribute specify a partial list as to what the client announcing the SMIMECapabilities can support.  A client does not have to list every capability it supports, and need not list all its capabilities so that the capabilities list doesn't get too long.  In an SMIMECapabilities attribute, the object identifiers (OIDs) are listed in order of their preference, but SHOULD be separated logically along the lines of their categories (signature algorithms, symmetric algorithms, key encipherment algorithms, etc.).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.4">The structure of the SMIMECapabilities attribute is to facilitate simple table lookups and binary comparisons in order to determine matches.  For instance, the DER-encoding for the SMIMECapability for AES-128 CBC MUST be identically encoded regardless of the implementation.  Because of the requirement for identical encoding, individuals documenting algorithms to be used in the SMIMECapabilities attribute SHOULD explicitly document the correct byte sequence for the common cases.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.5">For any capability, the associated parameters for the OID MUST specify all of the parameters necessary to differentiate between two instances of the same algorithm.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.6">The OIDs that correspond to algorithms SHOULD use the same OID as the actual algorithm, except in the case where the algorithm usage is ambiguous from the OID.  For instance, in an earlier specification, rsaEncryption was ambiguous because it could refer to either a signature algorithm or a key encipherment algorithm.  In the event that an OID is ambiguous, it needs to be arbitrated by the maintainer of the registered SMIMECapabilities list as to which type of algorithm will use the OID, and a new OID MUST be allocated under the smimeCapabilities OID to satisfy the other use of the OID.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.7">The registered SMIMECapabilities list specifies the parameters for OIDs that need them, most notably key lengths in the case of variable-length symmetric ciphers.

Several media types as well as several CMS content types are used.  The data to be secured is always a canonical MIME entity.  The MIME entity and other data, such as certificates and algorithm identifiers, are given to CMS processing facilities that produce a CMS object.  Finally, the CMS object is wrapped in MIME.  The Enhanced Security Services for S/&#8288;MIME <a href="#ESS">[ESS]</a> document provides descriptions of how nested, secured S/&#8288;MIME messages are formatted.  ESS provides a description of how a triple-wrapped S/&#8288;MIME message is formatted using multipart/&#8288;signed and application/&#8288;pkcs7-mime for the signatures.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">S/&#8288;MIME provides one format for enveloped-only data, several formats for signed-only data, and several formats for signed and enveloped data.

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">S/&#8288;MIME is used to secure MIME entities.  A MIME entity can be a sub- part, sub-parts of a message, or the whole message with all its sub- parts.  A MIME entity that is the whole message includes only the MIME message headers and MIME body, and does not include the RFC-822 header.  Note that S/&#8288;MIME can also be used to secure MIME entities used in applications other than Internet mail.  If protection of the RFC-822 header is required, the use of the message/rfc822 media type is explained later in this section.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">The MIME entity that is secured and described in this section can be thought of as the "inside" MIME entity.  That is, it is the "innermost" object in what is possibly a larger MIME message.  Processing "outside" MIME entities into CMS content types is described in <a href="#pkcs7-mime-media-type">Section 3.2</a>, <a href="#Signed-Only">Section 3.5</a>, and elsewhere.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">The procedure for preparing a MIME entity is given in <a href="#MIME-SPEC">[MIME-SPEC]</a>.  The same procedure is used here with some additional restrictions when signing.  The description of the procedures from <a href="#MIME-SPEC">[MIME-SPEC]</a> is repeated here, but it is suggested that the reader refer to that document for the exact procedure.  This section also describes additional requirements.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">A single procedure is used for creating MIME entities that are to have any combination of signing, enveloping, and compressing applied.  Some additional steps are recommended to defend against known corruptions that can occur during mail transport that are of particular importance for clear-signing using the multipart/&#8288;signed format.  It is recommended that these additional steps be performed on enveloped messages, or signed and enveloped messages, so that the message can be forwarded to any environment without modification.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.6">When an S/&#8288;MIME message is received, the security services on the message are processed, and the result is the MIME entity.

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.2">The exact details of canonicalization depend on the actual media type and subtype of an entity, and are not described here.  Instead, the standard for the particular media type SHOULD be consulted.  For example, canonicalization of type text/plain is different from canonicalization of audio/basic.  Other than text types, most types have only one representation regardless of computing platform or environment that can be considered their canonical representation.  In general, canonicalization will be performed by the non-security part of the sending agent rather than the S/&#8288;MIME implementation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.3">The most common and important canonicalization is for text, which is often represented differently in different environments.

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.1">When generating any of the secured MIME entities below, except the signing using the multipart/&#8288;signed format, no transfer encoding is required at all.  S/&#8288;MIME implementations MUST be able to deal with binary MIME objects.  If no Content-Transfer-Encoding header field is present, the transfer encoding is presumed to be 7BIT.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.2">S/&#8288;MIME implementations SHOULD however use transfer encoding described in <a href="#Transfer-multipart">Section 3.1.3</a> for all MIME entities they secure.  The reason for securing only 7-bit MIME entities, even for enveloped data that are not exposed to the transport, is that it allows the MIME entity to be handled in any environment without changing it.  For example, a trusted gateway might remove the envelope, but not the signature, of a message, and then forward the signed message on to the end recipient so that they can verify the signatures directly.  If the transport internal to the site is not 8-bit clean, such as on a wide- area network with a single mail gateway, verifying the signature will not be possible unless the original MIME entity was only 7-bit data.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.3">S/&#8288;MIME implementations that "know" that all intended recipients are capable of handling inner (all but the outermost) binary MIME objects SHOULD use binary encoding as opposed to a 7-bit-safe transfer encoding for the inner entities.  The use of a 7-bit-safe encoding (such as base64) would unnecessarily expand the message size.  Implementations MAY "know" that recipient implementations are capable of handling inner binary MIME entities either by interpreting the id- cap-preferBinaryInside SMIMECapabilities attribute, by prior agreement, or by other means.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.4">If one or more intended recipients are unable to handle inner binary MIME objects, or if this capability is unknown for any of the intended recipients, S/&#8288;MIME implementations SHOULD use transfer encoding described in <a href="#Transfer-multipart">Section 3.1.3</a> for all MIME entities they secure.  </p>

MIME entities that are 7-bit data already need no transfer encoding.  Entities such as 8-bit text and binary data can be encoded with quoted-printable or base-64 transfer encoding.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.3.p.2">The primary reason for the 7-bit requirement is that the Internet mail transport infrastructure cannot guarantee transport of 8-bit or binary data.  Even though many segments of the transport infrastructure now handle 8-bit and even binary data, it is sometimes not possible to know whether the transport path is 8-bit clean.  If a mail message with 8-bit data were to encounter a message transfer agent that cannot transmit 8-bit or binary data, the agent has three options, none of which are acceptable for a clear-signed message: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The agent could change the transfer encoding; this would invalidate the signature.  </li>
  <li>The agent could transmit the data anyway, which would most likely result in the 8th bit being corrupted; this too would invalidate the signature.  </li>
  <li>The agent could return the message to the sender.  </li>

<p><a href="#RFC1847">[RFC1847]</a> prohibits an agent from changing the transfer encoding of the first part of a multipart/&#8288;signed message.

=A1Hola Michael!

How do you like the new S/MIME specification?

It's generally a good idea to encode lines that begin with
From=20because some mail transport agents will insert a greater-
than (&gt;) sign, thus invalidating the signature.

Also, in some cases it might be desirable to encode any =20
trailing whitespace that occurs on lines in order to ensure =20
that the message signature is not invalidated when passing =20
a gateway that modifies such whitespace (like BITNET). =20

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">The application/&#8288;pkcs7-mime media type is used to carry CMS content types including EnvelopedData, SignedData, and CompressedData.  The details of constructing these entities are described in subsequent sections.  This section describes the general characteristics of the application/&#8288;pkcs7-mime media type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">The carried CMS object always contains a MIME entity that is prepared as described in <a href="#MimePrep">Section 3.1</a> if the eContentType is id-data.  Other contents MAY be carried when the eContentType contains different values.  See <a href="#ESS">[ESS]</a> for an example of this with signed receipts.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">Since CMS content types are binary data, in most cases base-64 transfer encoding is appropriate, in particular, when used with SMTP transport.  The transfer encoding used depends on the transport through which the object is to be sent, and is not a characteristic of the media type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">Note that this discussion refers to the transfer encoding of the CMS object or "outside" MIME entity.  It is completely distinct from, and unrelated to, the transfer encoding of the MIME entity secured by the CMS object, the "inside" object, which is described in <a href="#MimePrep">Section 3.1</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.5">Because there are several types of application/&#8288;pkcs7-mime objects, a sending agent SHOULD do as much as possible to help a receiving agent know about the contents of the object without forcing the receiving agent to decode the ASN.1 for the object.  The Content-Type header field of all application/&#8288;pkcs7-mime objects SHOULD include the optional "smime-type" parameter, as described in the following sections.  </p>

Sending agents SHOULD also emit the optional Content-Disposition field <a href="#RFC2138">[RFC2138]</a> with the "filename" parameter.  If a sending agent emits the above parameters, the value of the parameters SHOULD be a file name with the appropriate extension: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.p.2">In addition, the file name SHOULD be limited to eight characters followed by a three-letter extension.  The eight-character filename base can be any distinct name; the use of the filename base "smime" SHOULD be used to indicate that the MIME entity is associated with S/&#8288;MIME.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.p.3">Including a file name serves two purposes.  It facilitates easier use of S/&#8288;MIME objects as files on disk.  It also can convey type information across gateways.  When a MIME entity of type application/&#8288;pkcs7-mime (for example) arrives at a gateway that has no special knowledge of S/&#8288;MIME, it will default the entity's media type to application/&#8288;octet-stream and treat it as a generic attachment, thus losing the type information.  However, the suggested filename for an attachment is often carried across a gateway.  This often allows the receiving systems to determine the appropriate application to hand the attachment off to, in this case, a stand-alone S/&#8288;MIME processing application.  Note that this mechanism is provided as a convenience for implementations in certain environments.  A proper S/&#8288;MIME implementation MUST use the media types and MUST NOT rely on the file extensions.  </p>

  <li>If both signing and encryption can be applied to the content, then three values for smime-type SHOULD be assigned "signed-*", "authEnv-*", and "enveloped-*".  If one operation can be assigned, then this can be omitted.  Thus, since "certs-only" can only be signed, "signed-" is omitted.  </li>

  <li>If no common string is assigned, then the common string of "OID.&lt;oid&gt;" is recommended (for example, "OID.2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2" would be AES-128 CBC).  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.3">It is possible to apply any of the signing, encrypting, and compressing operations in any order.  It is up to the implementer and the user to choose.  When signing first, the signatories are then securely obscured by the enveloping.  When enveloping first the signatories are exposed, but it is possible to verify signatures without removing the enveloping.  This can be useful in an environment where automatic signature verification is desired, as no private key material is required to verify a signature.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.4">There are security ramifications to choosing whether to sign first or encrypt first.  A recipient of a message that is encrypted and then signed can validate that the encrypted block was unaltered, but cannot determine any relationship between the signer and the unencrypted contents of the message.  A recipient of a message that is signed then encrypted can assume that the signed message itself has not been altered, but that a careful attacker could have changed the unauthenticated portions of the encrypted message.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>Compression of binary encoded encrypted data is discouraged, since it will not yield significant compression.  Base64 encrypted data could very well benefit, however.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Cryptographic algorithms will be broken or weakened over time.  Implementers and users need to check that the cryptographic algorithms listed in this document continue to provide the expected level of security.  The IETF from time to time may issue documents dealing with the current state of the art.  For example: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The Million Message Attack described in RFC 3218 <a href="#RFC3218">[RFC3218]</a>.  </li>
  <li>The Diffie-Hellman "small-subgroup" attacks described in RFC 2785 <a href="#RFC2785">[RFC2785]</a>.  </li>
  <li>The attacks against hash algorithms described in RFC 4270 <a href="#RFC4270">[RFC4270]</a>.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">This specification uses Public-Key Cryptography technologies.  It is assumed that the private key is protected to ensure that it is not accessed or altered by unauthorized parties.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">It is impossible for most people or software to estimate the value of a message's content.  Further, it is impossible for most people or software to estimate the actual cost of recovering an encrypted message content that is encrypted with a key of a particular size.  Further, it is quite difficult to determine the cost of a failed decryption if a recipient cannot process a message's content.  Thus, choosing between different key sizes (or choosing whether to just use plaintext) is also impossible for most people or software.  However, decisions based on these criteria are made all the time, and therefore this specification gives a framework for using those estimates in choosing algorithms.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">The choice of 2048 bits as an RSA asymmetric key size in this specification is based on the desire to provide at least 100 bits of security.  The key sizes that must be supported to conform to this specification seem appropriate for the Internet based on <a href="#RFC3766">[RFC3766]</a>.  Of course, there are environments, such as financial and medical systems, that may select different key sizes.  For this reason, an implementation MAY support key sizes beyond those recommended in this specification.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.5">Receiving agents that validate signatures and sending agents that encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic processing usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages using keys larger than those mandated in this specification.  An attacker could send certificates with keys that would result in excessive cryptographic processing, for example, keys larger than those mandated in this specification, which could swamp the processing element.  Agents that use such keys without first validating the certificate to a trust anchor are advised to have some sort of cryptographic resource management system to prevent such attacks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.6">Using weak cryptography in S/&#8288;MIME offers little actual security over sending plaintext.  However, other features of S/&#8288;MIME, such as the specification of AES and the ability to announce stronger cryptographic capabilities to parties with whom you communicate, allow senders to create messages that use strong encryption.  Using weak cryptography is never recommended unless the only alternative is no cryptography.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.7">RSA and DSA keys of less than 2048 bits are now considered by many experts to be cryptographically insecure (due to advances in computing power), and should no longer be used to protect messages.  Such keys were previously considered secure, so processing previously received signed and encrypted mail will often result in the use of weak keys.  Implementations that wish to support previous versions of S/&#8288;MIME or process old messages need to consider the security risks that result from smaller key sizes (e.g., spoofed messages) versus the costs of denial of service.  If an implementation supports verification of digital signatures generated with RSA and DSA keys of less than 1024 bits, it MUST warn the user.  Implementers should consider providing different warnings for newly received messages and previously stored messages.  Server implementations (e.g., secure mail list servers) where user warnings are not appropriate SHOULD reject messages with weak signatures.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.8">Implementers SHOULD be aware that multiple active key pairs can be associated with a single individual.  For example, one key pair can be used to support confidentiality, while a different key pair can be used for digital signatures.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.9">If a sending agent is sending the same message using different strengths of cryptography, an attacker watching the communications channel might be able to determine the contents of the strongly encrypted message by decrypting the weakly encrypted version.  In other words, a sender SHOULD NOT send a copy of a message using weaker cryptography than they would use for the original of the message.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.10">Modification of the ciphertext in EnvelopedData can go undetected if authentication is not also used, which is the case when sending EnvelopedData without wrapping it in SignedData or enclosing SignedData within it.  This is one of the reasons for moving from EnvelopedData to AuthEnvelopedData as the authenticated encryption algorithms provide the authentication without needing the SignedData layer.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.11">If an implementation is concerned about compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) key size recommendations, then see <a href="#SP800-57">[SP800-57]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.12">If messaging environments make use of the fact that a message is signed to change the behavior of message processing (examples would be running rules or UI display hints), without first verifying that the message is actually signed and knowing the state of the signature, this can lead to incorrect handling of the message.  Visual indicators on messages may need to have the signature validation code checked periodically if the indicator is supposed to give information on the current status of a message.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.13">Many people assume that the use of an authenticated encryption algorithm is all that is needed to be in a situtation where the sender of the message will be authenticated.  In almost all cases this is not a correct statement.  There are a number of preconditions that need to hold for an authenticated encryption algorithm to provide this service: <a href="#RFC6278">[RFC6278]</a> which defined how to use static-static key agreement with CMS so that is readably doable.  Currently, all S/MIME key agreement methods derive a KEK and wrap a CEK.  This violates the third precondition above.  New key agreement algorithms that directly created the CEK without creating an intervening KEK would need to be defined.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>The starting key must be bound to a single entity.  The use of a group key only would allow for the statement that a message was sent by one of the entities that held the key but will not identify a specific entity.  </li>
  <li>The message must have exactly one sender and one recipient.  Having more than one recipient would allow for the second recipient to create a message that the first recipient would believe is from the sender by stripping them as a recipient from the message.  </li>
  <li>A direct path needs to exist from the starting key to the key used as the content encryption key (CEK) which guarantees that no third party could have seen the resulting CEK.  This means that one needs to be using an algorithm that is called a "Direct Encryption" or a "Direct Key Agreement" algorithm in other contexts.  This means that the starting key is used directly as the CEK key, or that the starting key is used to create a secret which then is transformed into the CEK via a KDF step.  </li>
</ul>

<p> S/MIME implementations almost universally use ephemeral-static rather than static-static key agreement and do not use a shared secret for encryption, this means that the first precondition is not met.  There is a document </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.14">Even when all of the preconditions are met and origination of a message is established by the use of an authenticated encryption algorithm, users need to be aware that there is no way to prove this to a third party.  This is because either of the parties can successfully create the message (or just alter the content) based on the fact that the CEK is going to be known to both parties.  Thus the origination is always built on a presumption that "I did not send this message to myself." </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.15">All of the authenticated encryption algorithms in this document use counter mode for the encryption portion of the algorithm.  This means that the length of the plain text will always be known as the cipher text length and the plain text length are always the same.  This information can enable passive observers to infer information based solely on the length of the message.  Applications for which this is a concern need to provide some type of padding so that the length of the message does not provide this information.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">Over the course of updating the S/MIME specifications, the set of recommended algorithms has been modified each time the document has been updated.  This means that if a user has historic emails and their user agent has been updated to only support the current set of recommended algorithms some of those old emails will no longer be accessible.  It is strongly suggested that user agents implement some of the following algorithms for dealing with historic emails.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.2">This appendix contains a number of references to documents that have been obsoleted or replaced, this is intentional as frequently the updated documents do not have the same information in them.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.B.1">B.1.</a> DigestAlgorithmIdentifier</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.1">The following algorithms have been called our for some level of support by previous S/MIME specifications: </p>

<ul>
  <li>SHA&#8209;1 was dropped in <a href="#SMIMEv4.0">[SMIMEv4.0]</a>.  SHA-1 is no longer considerd to be secure as it is no longer collision-resistant.  The IETF statement on SHA-1 can be found in <a href="#RFC6194">[RFC6194]</a> but it is out-of-date relative to the most recient advances.  </li>
  <li>MD5 was dropped in <a href="#SMIMEv4.0">[SMIMEv4.0]</a>.  MD5 is no longer considered to be secure as it is no longer collision-resistant.  Details can be found in <a href="#RFC6151">[RFC6151]</a>.  </li>

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.B.2">B.2.</a> Signature Algorithms</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.1">There are a number of problems with validating signatures on sufficently historic messages.  For this reason it is strongly suggested that UAs treat these signatures differently from those on current messages.  These problems include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>CAs are not required to keep certificates on a CRL beyond one update after a certificate has expired.  This means that unless CRLs are cached as part of the message it is not always possible to check if a certificate has been revoked.  The same problems exist with OCSP responses as they may be based on a CRL rather than on the certificate database.  </li>
  <li>RSA and DSA keys of less than 2048 bits are now considered by many experts to be cryptographically insecure (due to advances in computing power).  Such keys were previously considered secure, so processing of historic  signed messages  will often result in the use of weak keys.  Implementations that wish to support previous versions of S/&#8288;MIME or process old messages need to consider the security risks that result from smaller key sizes (e.g., spoofed messages) versus the costs of denial of service.  <br/><br/> <a href="#SMIMEv3.1">[SMIMEv3.1]</a> set the lower limit on suggested key sizes for creating and validation at 1024 bits.  Prior to that the lower bound on key sizes was 512 bits.  </li>
  <li>Hash functions used to validate signatures on historic messages may longer be considered to be secure.  (See below.) While there are not currently any known practical pre-image or second pre-image attacks against MD5 or SHA&#8209;1, the fact they are no longer considered to be collision resistent the security levels of the signatures are generally considered suspect.  </li>
  <li>The previous two issues apply to the certificates used to validate the binding of the public key to the identity that signed the message as well.  </li>
</ul>

<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.2">The following algorithms have been called out for some level of support by previous S/MIME specifications: </p>

  <li>S/&#8288;MIME v3 clients might only implement signing or signature verification using id-dsa-with-sha1, and might also use id-dsa as an AlgorithmIdentifier in this field.  </li>
