      <t>
        When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for the purpose of registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature algorithms.
        This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter values than would be possible using the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.
        This document describes the range of identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that range.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for use by that working group.
        The use of these object identifiers  allowed for the Edwards Ellitptic Curve key agreement <xref target="RFC7748"/> and signature <xref target="RFC8032"/> algorithms to be defined with encodings that are smaller than similar ones would be if assigned from the  existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.
        These initial registrations from this arc were done while developing <xref target="I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix"/>.
        After those registrations were done, there were still some unused values that can be used for other security groups.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) <xref target="ASN.1"/>.
        The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The donated range from DigiCert, Inc. is:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
first: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 100 }
last: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }

        <t>
          The column 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127 inclusive.
        </t>

        <t>
          The value of 100 has been reserved so that a new arc below that point can be established in the future.
          (I.e. starting at 1.3.101.100.1)
          If the new child registry is established, a name for this value is to be assigned at that point.
          The experts can, at their discretion, assign an algorithm OID instead.
        </t>

        <t>
          The registry is to be created using the "Specification Required" policy as defined in <xref target="RFC8126"/>.

        Our thanks go out to DigiCert for donating the range of OIDs covered in this document.
	At the time of the donation, the root of the range was assigned to Symantec but has sense been transfered DigiCert.
