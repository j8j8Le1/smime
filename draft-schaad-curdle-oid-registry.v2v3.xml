      <t>When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for the purpose of registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature algorithms.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use by that working group.  The use of these object identifiers  allowed for the Edwards Ellitptic Curve key agreement <xref target="RFC7748" format="default"/> and signature <xref target="RFC8032" format="default"/> algorithms to be defined with encodings that are smaller than similar ones would be if assigned from the  existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.  These initial registrations from this arc were done while developing <xref target="I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix" format="default"/>.  After those registrations were done, there were still some unused values that can be used for other security groups, there were still some unused values.  </t>
      <t>Object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) <xref target="ASN.1" format="default"/>.  The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.  </t>
      <t>This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments.  </t>
      <t>The donated range from Symantec Website Security is: </t>
